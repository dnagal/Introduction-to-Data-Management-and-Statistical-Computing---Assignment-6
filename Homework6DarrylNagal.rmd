## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Uploading the airbnb dataset into RStudio
```{r airbnb_los_angeles_2017_03_10}
library(dplyr)
airbnb <- read.csv("~/Downloads/airbnb_los_angeles_2017_03_10.csv", header = T)
```

## Using tapply to calculate mean price by neighborhood to a new dataframe called avg.price
```{r}
avg.price <- tapply(airbnb$price, airbnb$neighborhood, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

avg.price <- as.data.frame(avg.price)

head(avg.price)

rownames(avg.price)[which.max(avg.price$avg.price)]

avg.price %>%
filter(avg.price == max(avg.price))
```

## Using the summarise statement to find mean overall satisfaction
```{r}
library(dplyr)

airbnb %>%
  group_by(room_type) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_overall_satisfaction = mean(overall_satisfaction, na.rm = TRUE)
)

tab <- as.data.frame(tapply(airbnb$overall_satisfaction,
                            airbnb$room_type, mean))
colnames(tab) <- "avg_satisfaction"
tab
```

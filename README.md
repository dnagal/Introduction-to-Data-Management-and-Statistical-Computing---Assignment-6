# Introduction-to-Data-Management-and-Statistical-Computing---Assignment-6
One of our first assignments on R using tapply and summarize statements to find mean values for variables of interest

tapply was used to calculate the mean price of Airbnb rentals by neighborhood through a new dataframe called avg.price. 

The summarise statement was used to determine the mean overall satisfaction of Airbnb customers grouped by room type. This was the first assignment where we used %>% which helps to filter or select specific aspects of the dataset we are using in R.
